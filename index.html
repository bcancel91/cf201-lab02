        <p>I was born into a military family. My dad was a dentist in the <dfn>army</dfn> then in the mid 80's and on through the middle of the 90s, so a family move was always on the horizon. I spent a couple of years growing up in <dfn>Germany</dfn>. I was at the fall of the Berlin Wall, my folks even have a chunk of it that I chiseled out! We moved on to <dfn>New York</dfn>, and then on across the US to <dfn>Washington State</dfn>.

        <p> I spent the most of my formative years in Washington, save a few months in <dfn>Costa Rica</dfn> before heading to <dfn></dfn>Idaho</dfn> for college, where I received my higher education and met my wife. I graduated with a degree in Mass Communication with a focus on TV and film narrative, and then I went back later for my MBA. During all this time, we made Idaho our home, and had careers. I was a media producer for an international NGO, that took me to London, Engaland and Haiti, immediately proceeding Hurrican Matthew in 2016. The job was good, it was exciting, my wife was successful in her work, and we enjoyed the life. However we always had a goal to do something global, and landed upon Peace Corps as the ideal organization to join.

        <p> It took time - I like to say <q>it took 8 years to realize our 5 year plan</q> but ultimately, we were accepted by the Peace Corps and placed in Molepolole, Botswana. Until COVID-19 came upon us all, we were intending to <q>see the world</q> or at least a chunk of Europe, and perhaps stop by Dubai to see the 2020 World Expo. But our lives were upended, and suddendly we found ourselves back in our childhood state of Washington within the span of a week in March in 2020. And here I am.

          In Code Fellows, I aim to come away with the skills to excel in the workforce. To understand the skills, the code languages, and the industry lingo and shorthand so I can feel comfortable and prepared to keep on with the learning, the work, and gaining expertise for a career somewhere in tech.
